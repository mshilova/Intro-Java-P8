Scanner separates characters of the source code into tokens that            
logically belong together (primitive data types and simple identifiers).    
The stream of tokens is passed to the parser, that groups them together     
into syntactic structure.  

To run the program on the two test files type:

                          java P8 P8TestA.java   
                                  or
                          java P8 P8TestB.java
